I just realized something most people are going to lose when (as they inevitably will) they start using AIs to write everything for them. They'll lose the knowledge of how writing is constructed.

This is a very common kind of knowledge to be lost as technology progresses. Very few people now know how to weave cloth or turn pots or make baskets. But it's strange to think that writing will now enter this category.

And indeed I worry that something much bigger will be lost when most people stop writing. It's not that big a loss if you don't weave your own cloth. But writing is thinking. So if people stop writing, that's a whole kind of thinking they'll stop doing.

Schools may think they're going to stem this tide, but we should be honest about what's going to happen. Writing is hard and people don't like doing hard things. So adults will stop doing it, and it will feel very artificial to most kids who are made to.

Writing (and the kind of thinking that goes with it) will become like making pottery: little kids will do it in school, a few specialists will be amazingly good at it, and everyone else will be unable to do it at all.

My guess is that before calculators 3% of the population were really good at mental arithmetic, and now .3% are. The proportions will be similar with writing.
