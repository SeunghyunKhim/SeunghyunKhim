Strongly correlated electron systems.

How a system consisting of many ojects organizes inself into an ordered state.
In a condensed matter, the systems consistes of 'particles'.  
Usually it is an electron which carries a spin and charge.

Philip Ball [[critical mass]].  


Experimentally, my approach is to prepare, develope bulk single-crystalline material systems.
I need chemistry but I'm not a chemist.
