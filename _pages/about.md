I am Seunghyun Khim, currently living in Germany with my wife and two sons.

Here I work as a scientist in [Max Planck Insisutute for Chemical Physics of Solids](https://www.cpfs.mpg.de/person/132758/1453296).

My main reasearch focuses on synthesizing emergent quantum materials for studying strongly correlated electrons systems (SCES).

I am a regular [[run|runner]] and daily [[bicycle|bike]] commuter.

I am registed as a table tennis player competing at a local league.
