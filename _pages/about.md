*About me*

I am Seunghyun Khim, currently living in Germany with my wife and two sons.

Here I work as a staff scientist in [Max Planck Insisutute for Chemical Physics of Solids](https://www.cpfs.mpg.de/person/132758/1453296). My main reasearch focuses on synthesizing emergent quantum materials for studying strongly correlated electrons systems (SCES). Please find my list of publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Sattrc0AAAAJ&hl=ko).

I am an occational camper, a regular [[run|runner]], and a daily [[bicycle|bike]] commuter.

I also play table tennis player in a local club league.
